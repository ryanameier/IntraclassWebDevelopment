				<p>Bugcrowd is probably one of our favorite Rails applications, it connects businesses to hundreds to thousands of hackers to all test a website for potential bugs or vulnerabilities. It's a great way for large corporations or high value targets (banks) to test and protect their data. </p>
				<p>The process is pretty simple on the user side, a company posts a "bounty" each bug a hacker finds rewards them a bounty and therefore you get thousands of people working together on your application. Some may never even find a bug so they work for free, but if someone does, you protect yourself from an extremely expensive catastrophe for a small expense.</p>
				<p>If you would like to find out more about Bugcrowd please click on the link below and play with the interface. Bugcrowd was a group project worked on with the input of our previous employer prior to going freelance.</p>
				<p>You can preview Startup Framework <a href="http://bugcrowd.com/">here</a>.</p>
